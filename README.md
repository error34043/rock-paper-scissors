Created for the Web Developement 101 course on the Odin Project website. The script-console-only.js contains a purely JavaScript code that can only be run on the console. A web-playable version of the game with functioning UI has been made using the index.html, style.css, and script.js files. That playable version can be found [here](https://error34043.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).
